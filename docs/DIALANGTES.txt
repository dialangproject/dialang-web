This document describes the DIALANG Test Execution Script

The DIALANG Test Execution Script, henceforth to be referred to as the
'script', allows a system to control how a DIALANG test is run. The script can
control many behavioural aspects such as whether the VSPT test is run or
whether the test results are displayed.

The script is a RESTful endpoint whose URL is supplied during an LTI launch of
DIALANG. The script URL is supplied as a key value pair with the key
being: 'custom_dialang_tes_url'. When such a URL is supplied DIALANG issues a
GET request to it and expects a JSON document to be returned. That document
MUST contain these keys:

id - This is an id unique to the caller

al -    This is the administration language and takes the form of an iso
        language_region code. For example: cmn_cn or eng_gb.

tl -    This is the test language and takes the same form as the administration
        language.

skill - This is the test skill. It can take one of five values: 'reading',
        'writing', 'listening', 'structures', 'vocabulary'

hideVSPT - Skips the VSPT test if set to true. Set to true or false.

hideVSPTResult - Skips the VSPT test result if set to true. Set to true or false.

hideSA - Skips the SA stage if set to true. Set to true or false.

testDifficulty -    Specifies which test to deliver, 'easy', 'medium', or 'hard'.
                    Current unimplemented.

hideTest - Skips the item test stage if set to true. Set to true or false.

hideFeedbackMenu - Skips the feedback menu screen if set to true. Set to true or false.

disallowInstantFeedback - Disables the instant feedback buttons if set to true. Set to true or false.

testCompleteUrl - Specifies a callback url to be notified when the test has been completed. The 'id' is returned in the call.
